# Classificaion-of-Different-Traffic-signs

Problems Occured.
1. Overfitting, training accuracy > validation accuracy
2. Tough on the Traffic sign dataset because the reasons are as follows:
3. Comparitively less data, high number of classes to predict, unstructured/not uniform no. of samples in each classes can be visualised in the bar graph.
4. Try to fine tune the model.

Present Results:
Epoch 10/10
87/87 [==============================]  
- loss: 0.0894 
- accuracy: 0.9727 
- val_loss: 0.0824 
- val_accuracy: 0.9748
-Test evaluation 0.16157132387161255
-Test accuracy 0.9555027484893799



FINE TUNING = TASK DEPEDENCY
