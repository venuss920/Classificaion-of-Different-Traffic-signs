# a MULTICLASS-Classificaion-of-Different-Traffic-signs, 


Problems Occured.
1. Overfitting, training accuracy > validation accuracy
2. Tough on the Traffic sign dataset because the reasons are as follows:
3. Comparitively less data, high number of classes to predict, unstructured/not uniform no. of samples in each classes can be visualised in the bar graph.
4. Try to fine tune the model.

Present Results:
